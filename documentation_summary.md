# BasicAgent Documentation Summary

## Overview
The `BasicAgent` class has been documented for maintainability with clear, concise docstrings and inline comments.

## Documentation Improvements Made

### 1. Class-Level Documentation
Added comprehensive class docstring explaining:
- The five types of questions handled
- Key features (pure output, error handling, formatting)
- GAIA Level 1 compliance

### 2. Method Docstrings
Updated all major methods with concise docstrings that include:
- Brief purpose statement
- Args section with parameter descriptions
- Returns section describing output
- Key logic summary where helpful

### 3. Inline Comments
Added clarifying comments for:
- Complex regex patterns (e.g., calculation detection)
- Multi-step logic (e.g., string formatting with "of" extraction)
- Error handling (stderr redirection)
- Classification priorities

### 4. Code Clarity Improvements
- Fixed typo: "WERE" â†’ "WHERE" in header comment
- Added descriptive comments for pattern matching
- Explained tokenization in arithmetic parser
- Clarified single-value CSV handling

## Key Documentation Patterns

### Concise Docstrings
```python
def method_name(self, param: Type) -> ReturnType:
    """
    Brief one-line purpose.
    
    Args:
        param: Description of parameter
        
    Returns:
        Description of return value
    """
```

### Inline Comment Style
- Explain "why" not "what" for complex logic
- Add clarification for regex patterns
- Document edge cases and special handling

## Benefits
1. **Maintainability**: Clear understanding of each method's purpose
2. **Onboarding**: New developers can quickly understand the codebase
3. **Debugging**: Comments explain non-obvious logic decisions
4. **Consistency**: Uniform documentation style throughout

The `BasicAgent` class is now well-documented for long-term maintenance while keeping the documentation concise and focused on clarity.
