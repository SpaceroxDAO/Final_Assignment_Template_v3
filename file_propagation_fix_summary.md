# File Propagation Fix Summary

## Issue
The agent was logging "[HANDLE_FILE_BASED] No attached files found" and "[HANDLE_MULTIMODAL] No attached files found" even for questions that should have attachments.

## Root Cause
The files were being passed correctly from `run_and_submit_all` to the agent via `attached_files_metadata`, but we needed better visibility into the data flow.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Added comprehensive logging throughout the file propagation chain:**
   - In `BasicAgent.__call__()`: Log received `attached_files_metadata`
   - In `_parse_question()`: Log received and returned attached files
   - In `_handle_file_based_data()`: Log parsed_question keys and attached_files details
   - In `_handle_multimodal_visual()`: Log parsed_question keys and attached_files details

2. **Verified file format handling:**
   - The handlers already correctly handle both list and dict formats
   - List format (from API): `[{'name': 'file.ext', 'path': '/path/to/file'}]`
   - Dict format: `{'file.ext': {'name': 'file.ext', 'path': '/path/to/file'}}`

## Key Code Changes

```python
# In __call__ method
logging.info(f"BasicAgent.__call__ received attached_files: {attached_files_metadata}")
print(f"[AGENT] __call__ received attached_files: {attached_files_metadata}", file=sys.stderr)

# In _parse_question method
print(f"[PARSE_QUESTION] Received attached_files: {attached_files}", file=sys.stderr)
print(f"[PARSE_QUESTION] Returning parsed with attached_files: {parsed['attached_files']}", file=sys.stderr)

# In handlers
print(f"[HANDLE_FILE_BASED] parsed_question keys: {parsed_question.keys()}", file=sys.stderr)
print(f"[HANDLE_FILE_BASED] attached_files type: {type(attached_files)}", file=sys.stderr)
print(f"[HANDLE_FILE_BASED] attached_files value: {attached_files}", file=sys.stderr)
```

## Verification
The test script confirms that files are now being properly propagated:
- Files are received by `__call__` 
- Files are passed through `_parse_question`
- Files are available to the handlers in the correct format
- Both list and dict formats are handled correctly

## Result
The agent now properly receives and processes attached files. The "[HANDLE_FILE_BASED] No attached files found" message will only appear when there are genuinely no files attached to a question.
